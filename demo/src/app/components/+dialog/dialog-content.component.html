    Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular combines declarative templates,
    dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular
    empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop
  </p>

  <h3>Architecture overview</h3>

  <p>
    Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript. Angular is itself
    written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you
    import into your apps.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation context for
    components. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. An
    app always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.
  </p>

  <p>
    Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to
    your program logic and data. Every app has at least a root component.
  </p>

  <p>
    Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can
    be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark their type and provide metadata that
    tells Angular how to use them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. A template combines ordinary
    HTML with Angular directives and binding markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it for
    display.
  </p>

  <p>
    The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available to components through
    Dependency Injection (DI).
  </p>

  <p>
    An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides the Router service to
    help you define navigation paths among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational
    capabilities.
