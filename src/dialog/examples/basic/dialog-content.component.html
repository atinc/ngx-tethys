    Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency
    injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build
    applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop
  </p>

  <h3>Architecture overview</h3>

  <p>
    Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript. Angular is itself written in TypeScript. It
    implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation context for components. NgModules collect
    related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a root module that
    enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.

  <thy-select thySize="md" [thyShowSearch]="true" thyEmptyStateText="无匹配结果" [thyAllowClear]="allowClear" [thyHasBackdrop]="true">
    <thy-option thyValue="" thyLabelText="空"></thy-option>
    <thy-option thyValue="1" thyLabelText="选项1"> </thy-option>
    <thy-option thyValue="2" thyLabelText="选项2"> </thy-option>
    <thy-option thyValue="3" thyLabelText="选项3"> </thy-option>
    <thy-option thyValue="4" thyLabelText="选项4"> </thy-option>
  </thy-select>
  <p>
    Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and
    data. Every app has at least a root component.
  </p>

  <p>
    Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into
    components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use
    them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. A template combines ordinary HTML with Angular
    directives and binding markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it for display.
  </p>

  <p>
    The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available to components through Dependency Injection
    (DI).
  </p>

  <p>
    An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides the Router service to help you define
    navigation paths among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.
