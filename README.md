# Development

> Only for library contributors.

## Clone and installation

```
$ git clone git@github.com:atinc/ngx-tethys.git
$ cd ngx-tethys
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run start
```

## Release & Publish

1. Run `pnpm run release` to release new version, this command will does the following:
   - Checkout to `master` and identifies current version and latest tag.
   - Prompts for a new version to select.
   - Create a release branch as `release-v1.0.0`
   - Modifies package metadata (package.json, version.ts) to reflect new release and generate changelog
   - Commits those changes to release branch.
   - Pushes to the git remote.

   You can run `pnpm run release -- [patch|minor|major|2.0.0]` to skip the version selection prompt and increment the version by that keyword or specify version.

1. Submit pull request from release branch to master(don't merge it)
1. GitHub Actions will auto build and publish lib

Release the next version requires executing `pnpm run release-next`

Manually release version requires executing `pnpm run release-manual`

`pnpm run release -- --dry-run` or `pnpm run pub -- --dry-run`

running with the flag `--dry-run` allows you to see what commands would be run, without committing to git or updating files. (意思就是打印一下日志让你看看做了哪些步骤，但是并不会真的执行脚本，你可以放心的执行)

## Notes

1. Don't use `barrel index` (should directly import specify component in module, don't import `index.ts`)
1. Should exports component module in `public-api.ts`
